About the Little Green Larder

The Little Green Larder is an independent retailer that wants to make a difference
to the world, therefore Jillian opened the first zero waste / ecofriendly shop in
Dundee by trying to encourage people to reduce carbon footprints and the waste of plastic.

The shop offers a wide range of eco-friendly products such as plastic free
toiletries, cleaning supplies, beauty products, dried food, whole food, fresh food
and snacks along with eco friendly alternatives for everyday items.

The shop is also collaborating with TerraCycleUK and ColgateUK by collecting
plastic toothbrushes in the shop and recycling them instead of sending them to landfills.

Customers can take in their own glass jars and re-use plastic bottles to fill-up on
cleaning materials which are dispensed from plastic pumps, offering a wide range
of packaging free products such as free-range eggs, flour and oil.

The shop has been mentioned multiple times on different newspapers as one of 
the leading green shop in Dundee and Scotland.
