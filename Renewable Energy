Climate change has been described as “the long-term shift in average
weather pattern across the world” (Met Office, 2019) and the importance of this is that
humans have been playing a key role in worsening it.

This is due to the level of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide humans
contribute to exerting into the air, which then ultimately forms a blanket in the
atmosphere that traps heat and therefore warms up the earth.

The increasing global temperature is what is known as climate change and it has
been the leading cause of damaging the earth and its many habitats.



This is particularly why there is a vast need for sustainable energy such as
renewable energy as they contribute towards zero carbon emissions and therefore 
provide a clean energy source which is ultimately better for the environment.

There are several different forms of renewable energy such as wind, waves, tidal,
geothermal, biomass, hydro-electric, etc.

These renewable sources have many benefits, one of the biggest being that it is
infinite which means that there is a limitless supply of it.

Another reason being that they can help mitigate the effects of climate change by
replacing fossil fuels (biggest contributors of greenhouse gases) as the new sustainable energy source.



Scotland’s renewable electricity capacity has shown steady growth over the last few
years with the average annual capacity increase over 760MW since the end of 2008. ​

In 2015, renewables were the largest source of electricity generated
in Scotland (42%) – higher than both nuclear generation (35%) and fossil fuel generation (22%).​

In 2016, Scotland’s electricity came from 43% renewables.

For renewable generation only, the proportion generated in Scotland accounted for
24% of the UK total generation in 2016, which was a fall from 26% in 2015

Scotland has an ambitious energy strategy and the Scottish Government is
fully committed to fulfilling its targets which include: ​


Generating 100% of Scotland's electricity demand from renewables by 2020 which was at 74.6% in 2018​

Delivering 50% of Scotland's total energy consumption from renewables by 2030
